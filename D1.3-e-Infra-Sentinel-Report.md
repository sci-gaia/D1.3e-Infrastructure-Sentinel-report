# Introduction

<!-- tell the story of e-Infrastructure in Africa -->
<!-- main players in the networking, computing and data spaces -->

Access to digital infrastructure has long been seen as a means to accelerate the development of African society, leading to the term "digital divide".
There have thus been many interventions to address this.
An illustrative example is the investment in network connectivity and capacity can be considered.
In recent years, Africa has seen not only greatly increased network capacity landing on it's shores via undersea cables, but also extension of that capacity deeper into the hinterland and across borders^[citation needed].
Network connectivity provides the _potential_ to overcome aspects of the digital divide, but does not guarantee it.
A recent G20 policy brief argues^[Chetty, K., Aneja, U., Mishra, V., Gcora, N. & Josie, J. (2017) Bridging the digital divide: skills for the new age. (G20-Insights Policy Brief, March).] that _new skills_ are needed as well, in order to bridge the divide.

Science and technology go hand in hand, and exclusion from the one often implies exclusion from the other.
In many fields of scientific endeavour, it is impossible to compete or participate without access to the instruments and tools which are used in that field, such as synchrotrons, telescopes, gene sequencers, nuclear-magnetic resonance scanners, _etc_.
However, scientists across the world have been enabled not only by these specialised machines, but also by the networks which connect them from their far-flung location to the other scientists using them, the data which they generate and the scientific applications and output which are used to analyse, interpret and disseminate them.
Exclusion from _this_ infrastructure - the infrastructure of modern digital science, and the skills which accompany it - severely affects efforts to address any form of development, particularly sustainable development^[See the UN Sustanable Development Goals http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/].  

##  Document background and strategy.

The Sci-GaIA project was run during a particularly sensitive period in the development of e-Infrastructures in Africa.

## Scope

This document does not attempt to portray an exhaustive survey of the outlook for e-Infrastructure in Africa - the rate of change of underlying factors such as population demographics, public-sector investment, technology trends, _etc_ alone make this a Sisyphean task.
The geographical scope alone makes this a task more suited to larger agencies or projects.
Neither do we consider it to be worthwhile to focus on individual projects, outcomes or results, which one may be tempted to see as indicative of trends.
The cross-cutting nature and ubiquity of e-Infrastructures in supporting modern science means that their are several narratives and interpretations.
Bodies such as the [e-Infrastructure Reflection Group (e-IRG)](http://www.e-irg.org) provide a useful canvas against which to draw our vision and recommendations, however.  

Furthermore, this document takes its cue from the project proposal :

>  To ensure the interoperability and interoperation between the African, the EU and other regions of the world’s e-Infrastructures, this task will establish an e-Infrastructure “sentinel” to watch over other relevant activities across the world.
> This task will periodically report to the other WPs to ensure efforts are harmonised with other global activities and will support the dissemination of our work to other projects worldwide.
> This task will have a single deliverable that will report on the global “picture” of e-Infrastructures and how developments within our project interoperate with other initiatives worldwide.

Rather than attempt to provide a complete description of e-Infrastructures in Africa, we therefore limit our scope to the experience during the project, focussing on efforts to maintain and extend interoperability between sites and initiatives participating or associated to the [Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre (AAROC)](http://www.africa-grid.org)

As such, this document should not be seen as an authoritative source on the state of e-Infrastructure in Africa, but an informed opinion on specific aspects of it which have evolved during the course of the project.
We provide our interpretation of the state of affairs and recommendations based thereupon.


# The General e-Infrastructure Landscape

<!-- talk about patterns in e-Infrastructure  -->
<!-- Follow  the format of http://e-irg.eu/catalogue/eirg-1004 -->



## Networking
<!-- general developments and comments in networking -->
<!-- Add discussion on undersea cables, broadband fibre and innovative networks -->

Network connectivity is the foundation of e-Infrastructures. Africa - particularly West and Central Africa - has lagged behind Europe and North-America in terms of access to network infrastructure by research and academic communities. This has in the past stifled the capacity and  ambition to undertake large science projects.
Compared with just 10 years ago, the situation in many countries in the Southern and Eastern African region has improved markedly. Undersea cables
