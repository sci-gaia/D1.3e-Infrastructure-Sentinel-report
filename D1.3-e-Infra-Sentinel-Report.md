# Introduction

<!-- tell the story of e-Infrastructure in Africa -->
<!-- main players in the networking, computing and data spaces -->

Access to digital infrastructure has long been seen as a means to accelerate the development of African society, leading to the term "digital divide".
There have thus been many interventions to address this.
An illustrative example is the investment in network connectivity and capacity can be considered.
In recent years, Africa has seen not only greatly increased network capacity landing on it's shores via undersea cables, but also extension of that capacity deeper into the hinterland and across borders.
Network connectivity provides the _potential_ to overcome aspects of the digital divide, but does not guarantee it.
A recent G20 policy brief [@insights] argues that _new skills_ are needed as well, in order to bridge the divide.

Science and technology go hand in hand, and exclusion from the one often implies exclusion from the other.
In many fields of scientific endeavour, it is impossible to compete or participate without access to the instruments and tools which are used in that field, such as synchrotrons, telescopes, gene sequencers, nuclear-magnetic resonance scanners, _etc_.
However, scientists across the world have been enabled not only by these specialised machines, but also by the networks which connect them from their far-flung location to the other scientists using them, the data which they generate and the scientific applications and output which are used to analyse, interpret and disseminate them.
Exclusion from _this_ infrastructure - the infrastructure of modern digital science, and the skills which accompany it - severely affects efforts to address any form of development, particularly sustainable development^[See the UN Sustainable Development Goals http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/].  

##  Document background and strategy.

The Sci-GaIA project was run during a particularly sensitive period in the development of e-Infrastructures in Africa.
For much of 21st century, e-Infrastructures were not resolvable at a regional level in Africa, since there was simply no real development or resources. Taking a network-centric point of view, it could  be argued that features of national regional e-Infrastructure started  to emerge with the development of the regional NRENs - UbuntuNet Alliance, ASREN and WACREN respectively.
From the point of view of scientific research programmes, it could be argued that regional e-Infrastructure started to emerge once Africans had access to big science projects, such as the LHC experiments at CERN^[TODO African institutes participate to the LHC experiments.], the Co-Ordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)^[TODO Universities in Africa participated.], more recently the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3A) project^[TODO 20 institutes in Africa], or indeed the MeerKAT and Square Kilometer Array projects^[TODO SKA partners], to name just a few.
These projects, and others of their scale, have a few factors in common :

  * Several institutes in Africa participating
  * Large data sets requiring long-term acquisition and preservation
  * Wide geographic distribution

A similar perspective could be envisaged taking the point of view of data or other scholarly output. The need for better access to - for lack of a better word - _libraries_ has stifled the pace of African research output significantly.
In each of these cases, cost and privilege played their role in stretching the digital divide even wider and constricting the capacity to generate, share and disseminate knowledge in Africa.

We would point out one aspect in particular though - the need for _co-operation_ in providing computing resources to their communities.
The services, infrastructures and resources needed could not be built, operated or maintained by one single institute or group; what is more, their functions were so generic as to stir interest in them across almost all research domains.
This need for co-operation has in many cases led to the creation of regional and national organisations in order to provide the scale necessary to build the human, technical and indeed capital resources necessary to fulfil the aims of various research agendas.

In the early 2000's, several efforts were funded by the European Commission in particular to promote cooperation between African and European e-Infrastructures. Chief amongst these for the purposes of this report are the CHAIN[@andronico2011infrastructures] and CHAIN-REDS[@barbera2014chain],[@prnjat_enabling_2015] projects.
These two projects looked specifically at the technical and policy aspects necessary to enable both the internal sustainability of regional infrastructures, as well as the inter-operability of these as a whole across regions. 

## Scope

This document does not attempt to portray an exhaustive survey of the outlook for e-Infrastructure in Africa - the rate of change of underlying factors such as population demographics, public-sector investment, technology trends, _etc_ alone make this a Sisyphean task.
The geographical scope alone makes this a task more suited to larger agencies or projects.
Neither do we consider it to be worthwhile to focus on individual projects, outcomes or results, which one may be tempted to see as indicative of trends.
The cross-cutting nature and ubiquity of e-Infrastructures in supporting modern science means that their are several narratives and interpretations.
Bodies such as the [e-Infrastructure Reflection Group (e-IRG)](http://www.e-irg.org) provide a useful canvas against which to draw our vision and recommendations, however.  

Furthermore, this document takes its cue from the project proposal :

>  To ensure the interoperability and interoperation between the African, the EU and other regions of the world’s e-Infrastructures, this task will establish an e-Infrastructure “sentinel” to watch over other relevant activities across the world.
> This task will periodically report to the other WPs to ensure efforts are harmonised with other global activities and will support the dissemination of our work to other projects worldwide.
> This task will have a single deliverable that will report on the global “picture” of e-Infrastructures and how developments within our project interoperate with other initiatives worldwide.

Rather than attempt to provide a complete description of e-Infrastructures in Africa, we therefore limit our scope to the experience during the project, focussing on efforts to maintain and extend interoperability between sites and initiatives participating or associated to the [Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre (AAROC)](http://www.africa-grid.org)

As such, this document should not be seen as an authoritative source on the state of e-Infrastructure in Africa, but an informed opinion on specific aspects of it which have evolved during the course of the project.
We provide our interpretation of the state of affairs and recommendations based thereupon.


# The General e-Infrastructure Landscape

<!-- talk about patterns in e-Infrastructure  -->
<!-- Follow  the format of http://e-irg.eu/catalogue/eirg-1004 -->



## Networking
<!-- general developments and comments in networking -->


Network connectivity is the foundation of e-Infrastructures. Africa - particularly West and Central Africa - has lagged behind Europe and North-America in terms of access to network infrastructure by research and academic communities. This has in the past stifled the capacity and  ambition to undertake large science projects.
Compared with just 10 years ago, the situation in countries in the Southern and Eastern African region has improved markedly. Undersea cables  such as SEACOM^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEACOM_(African_cable_system] and WACS^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WACS_(cable_system)] have not only increased the capacity of available bandwidth, but drastically reduced the price of international bandwidth[@ITUpricing].
