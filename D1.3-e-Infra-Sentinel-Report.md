    abstract: Cloud computing is an ascending technology that has introduced a new paradigm
      by rendering a rational computational model possible. It has changed the dynamics
      of IT consumption by means of a model that provides on-demand services over the
      Internet. Unlike the traditional hosting service, cloud computing services are
      paid for per usage and may expand or shrink based on demand. Such services are,
      in general, fully managed by cloud providers that require users nothing but a
      personal computer and an Internet access. In recent years, this model has attracted
      the attention of researchers, investors and practitioners, many of whom have proposed
      a number of applications, structures and fundamentals of cloud computing, resulting
      in various definitions, requirements and models. Despite the interest and advances
      in the field, issues such as security and privacy, service layer agreement, resource
      sharing, and billing have opened up new questions about the real gains of the
      model. Although cloud computing is based on a 50-year-old business model, evidence
      from this study indicates that cloud computing still needs to expand and overcome
      present limitations that prevent the full use of its potential. In this study,
      we critically review the state of the art in cloud computing with the aim of identifying
      advances, gaps and new challenges.

# Introduction

<!-- tell the story of e-Infrastructure in Africa -->
<!-- main players in the networking, computing and data spaces -->

Access to digital infrastructure has long been seen as a means to accelerate the development of African society, leading to the term "digital divide".
There have thus been many interventions to address this.
An illustrative example is the investment in network connectivity and capacity can be considered.
In recent years, Africa has seen not only greatly increased network capacity landing on it's shores via undersea cables, but also extension of that capacity deeper into the hinterland and across borders.
Network connectivity provides the _potential_ to overcome aspects of the digital divide, but does not guarantee it.
A recent G20 policy brief [@insights] argues that _new skills_ are needed as well, in order to bridge the divide.

Science and technology go hand in hand, and exclusion from the one often implies exclusion from the other.
In many fields of scientific endeavour, it is impossible to compete or participate without access to the instruments and tools which are used in that field, such as synchrotrons, telescopes, gene sequencers, nuclear-magnetic resonance scanners, _etc_.
However, scientists across the world have been enabled not only by these specialised machines, but also by the networks which connect them from their far-flung location to the other scientists using them, the data which they generate and the scientific applications and output which are used to analyse, interpret and disseminate them.
Exclusion from _this_ infrastructure - the infrastructure of modern digital science, and the skills which accompany it - severely affects efforts to address any form of development, particularly sustainable development^[See the UN Sustainable Development Goals http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/].  

## Scope

This document does not attempt to portray an exhaustive survey of the outlook for e-Infrastructure in Africa - the rate of change of underlying factors such as population demographics, public-sector investment, technology trends, _etc_ alone make this a Sisyphean task.
The geographical scope alone makes this a task more suited to larger agencies or projects.
Neither do we consider it to be worthwhile to focus on individual projects, outcomes or results, which one may be tempted to see as indicative of trends.
The cross-cutting nature and ubiquity of e-Infrastructures in supporting modern science means that their are several narratives and interpretations.
Bodies such as the [e-Infrastructure Reflection Group (e-IRG)](http://www.e-irg.org) provide a useful canvas against which to draw our vision and recommendations, however.  

Furthermore, this document takes its cue from the project proposal :

>  To ensure the interoperability and interoperation between the African, the EU and other regions of the world’s e-Infrastructures, this task will establish an e-Infrastructure “sentinel” to watch over other relevant activities across the world.
> This task will periodically report to the other WPs to ensure efforts are harmonised with other global activities and will support the dissemination of our work to other projects worldwide.
> This task will have a single deliverable that will report on the global “picture” of e-Infrastructures and how developments within our project interoperate with other initiatives worldwide.

Rather than attempt to provide a complete description of e-Infrastructures in Africa, we therefore limit our scope to the experience during the project, focussing on efforts to maintain and extend interoperability between sites and initiatives participating or associated to the [Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre (AAROC)](http://www.africa-grid.org).
An implication of this scope is that we will discuss mostly network and compute  infrastructure, which is the most formalised aspect of interoperability, with more or less formal arrangements in place for interoperability at a low level.
In the case of compute platforms, this is governed by an MoU between the European Grid Initiative (EGI.eu) and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) as representatives of European and African distributed computing infrastructures respectively, which we discuss in [Section: TODO](#computing)

As such, this document should not be seen as an authoritative source on the state of e-Infrastructure in Africa, but an informed opinion on specific aspects of it which have evolved during the course of the project.
We provide our interpretation of the state of affairs and recommendations based thereupon.

## The need for an e-Infrastructure Sentinel

The Sci-GaIA project was run during a particularly sensitive period in the development of e-Infrastructures in Africa.

For much of 21st century, e-Infrastructures were not resolvable at a regional level in Africa, since there was simply no real development or resources. Taking a network-centric point of view, it could  be argued that features of national regional e-Infrastructure started  to emerge with the development of the regional NRENs - UbuntuNet Alliance, ASREN and WACREN respectively.
From the point of view of scientific research programmes, it could be argued that regional e-Infrastructure started to emerge once Africans had access to big science projects, such as the LHC experiments at CERN^[TODO African institutes participate to the LHC experiments.], the Co-Ordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)^[TODO Universities in Africa participated.], more recently the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3A) project^[TODO 20 institutes in Africa], or indeed the MeerKAT and Square Kilometer Array projects^[TODO SKA partners], to name just a few.
These projects, and others of their scale, have a few factors in common :

  * Several institutes in Africa participating
  * Large data sets requiring long-term acquisition and preservation
  * Wide geographic distribution

A similar perspective could be envisaged taking the point of view of data or other scholarly output. The need for better access to - for lack of a better word - _libraries_ has stifled the pace of African research output significantly.
In each of these cases, cost and privilege played their role in stretching the digital divide even wider and constricting the capacity to generate, share and disseminate knowledge in Africa.

We would point out one aspect in particular though - the need for _co-operation_ in providing computing resources to their communities.
The services, infrastructures and resources needed could not be built, operated or maintained by one single institute or group; what is more, their functions were so generic as to stir interest in them across almost all research domains.
This need for co-operation has in many cases led to the creation of regional and national organisations in order to provide the scale necessary to build the human, technical and indeed capital resources necessary to fulfil the aims of various research agendas.

In the early 2000's, several efforts were funded by the European Commission in particular to promote cooperation between African and European e-Infrastructures. Chief amongst these for the purposes of this report are the CHAIN[@andronico2011infrastructures] and CHAIN-REDS[@barbera2014chain],[@prnjat_enabling_2015] projects.
These two projects looked specifically at the technical and policy aspects necessary to enable both the internal sustainability of regional infrastructures, as well as the inter-operability of these as a whole across regions.
They were conceived during the "crossover" phase between the end of the EGEE series of projects and their spinoffs in world regions^[We refer here to the long list of "EU-X-Grid" projects: EUAsiaGrid, EUIndiaGrid, EUChinaGrid, EUMedGrid and EELA/GISELA. ] and the start of EGI, EUDAT and other
Whilst modest in initial impact, compared to the massive investments currently undertaken by _e.g._ the Square Kilometer Array, these support actions served to create a  community of technical skill at a continental scale which persist to this day.

## Networking
<!-- general developments and comments in networking -->


Network connectivity is the foundation of e-Infrastructures. Africa - particularly West and Central Africa - has lagged behind Europe and North-America in terms of access to network infrastructure by research and academic communities. This has in the past stifled the capacity and  ambition to undertake large science projects.
Compared to the turn of the century, the situation in countries in the Southern and Eastern African region has improved markedly.
Undersea cables (See +@fig:undersea_cables ) such as SEACOM^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEACOM_(African_cable_system] and WACS^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WACS_(cable_system)] have not only increased the capacity of available bandwidth, but drastically reduced the price of international bandwidth[@ITUpricing],[@internet_society_international_2016].

![The evolution of undersea cables in Africa [@song_sub-saharan_2016].](images/output/tmp-16.png){#fig:undersea_cables width=16cm}

The effect of cheaper bandwidth has been augmented by a greater number of routes, as well as greater flexibility in routing and improved reliability. A corresponding effort has also been made to improve the backhaul capacity[@noauthor_afterfibre_nodate] and regional peering.

However, the vast geographic scale and sparsity of African countries has implications for  the reach of expensive fibre networks.
To  this end, a significant body of research has been published regarding the feasibility of wireless broadband networks.
We note here the Serengeti Broadband Network (SBN) [@nungu_design_2011] which is one of the innovative means of connecting people and instruments in difficult, sparse terrain.

<!-- Africa Connect -->

The wealth of network capacity and connections continues to open ever more possibilities for human networks, in all aspects of human endeavour, but particularly in the domains of education, research and science.
Whether this increase in potential will translate into more and better scientific output depends on several factors, including co-ordination.  
To this end, the [AfricaConnect](https://www.africaconnect.eu/Pages/Home.aspx) and [AfricaConnect 2](https://www.africaconnect2.net/Pages/Home.aspx) projects have provided significant impact down to the  "last-person" - the African researcher sitting in the African institute.
With a solid situation in research and education networking, advanced services for science can be constructed.

### Science DMZs

<!-- talk about the use of dmz's -->
We note here one particular aspect of exploiting R&E networking to it's fullest, which has implications for subsequent services and resources described  below : demilitarised zones for science (Science DMZs)^[See the ESNet web page for a good description and discussion of Science DMZs: https://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/].

Science DMZ's  are "A network design pattern for data-intensive science" [@6877518], allowing greater end-to-end performance for scientific applications.
A few African NRENs^[In particular SANREN and KENET in South Africa and Kenya respectively.] have recently begun work on designing and implementing Science DMZ's in their region.
The outlook on wider deployment and interoperability between DMZ's is currently difficult to predict, but is necessary for the needs of distributed research projects such as H3A or the SKA.

## Computing infrastructures

<!--- hpc and grid Infrastructures -->
Computing infrastructures here refer specifically to "grid" and "HPC" infrastructures, while we discuss more amorphous cloud computing infrastructures below.
The distinction  between these and cloud infrastructures refers rather to the static nature of the former rather than any aspect of the typical workloads which are run on them.
HPC infrastructures, whether centralised in national facilities or distributed in grids across institutes, have matured significantly over the last 5 years or so, to the point that there are several standards for easily deploying these resources and many common approaches in operating them.
The cutting edge of HPC^[For consistency, we refer to the Top500 list as "the cutting edge".] is advancing exponentially [@top500] thanks to advances both in hardware and software, enabling higher resolution and scale in the quest for scientific knowledge.
However, the cutting edge belies the bulk of research which requires  simply access to comparatively pedestrian computing facilities, built cheaply with off-the-shelf components.
While still expensive for the average African institute, these smaller HPC clusters have been quietly advancing the research capacity and output across the region.
Their aggregation into grids, and operation as service-oriented platforms led to better collaboration at a technical level between institutes, and allowed researchers to consider problems and projects at scales previously impossible. The move to service-based platforms also helped to stimulate interest in the development and use of various clouds for research, which we discuss below in [Section TODO](#cloud_infrastructures).

<!-- What is the outlook ? -->

High-performance computing clusters are by their nature localised and have tended to act as attractors of expertise, in terms of building, maintaining and operating them.
With the maturity of  the "Infrastructure as Code" [@huttermann_infrastructure_2012] in the early 2010's, there was far better means to share technical know-how as well as tools to automate and reproduce the deployment of these and other services.
A similar effect has seen the better delivery of HPC applications, and improved their portability across sites, providing users with bet
We discuss this later  in [Section TODO](#infrastructure_as_code).
The upshot is that it is becoming easier to rapidly scale and deliver both centralised and distributed computing facilities.

<!-- where are there sites ? -->
The Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre coordinates the computing resources at 9 sites^[See http://www.africa-grid.org/sites] across the African continent, making them available to users from these countries.



## Data Infrastructures
<!-- What data infrastructures are there ? -->

The importance of data infrastructures has been repeatedly stated, but these are far more difficult to harmonise and scale, in comparison  to the computing infrastructures we have mentioned in the previous section.
The need to develop sustainable data infrastructures is made clearly in the RDA report on "Reaping the Data Harvest" [@europe2014data]

## Clouds

Cloud computing is a business and operations model which offers various resources _as a service_ to users. This has evolved into essentially three main service models [@Durao2014] :

  * **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
  * **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
  * **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

The models differ in their usage and access models, but more importantly in the level of _flexibility_ vis-a-vis _ease of use_ for end  users.
By comparison, the grid computing paradigm offered a platform as a service, with an inflexible access model, and limited control over execution models.
The increased flexibility of the cloud computing model was thus very attractive to users and sites which were discouraged by the rigid model of grid computing.
The cloud _business_ model made it easier to access relevant computing platforms _on demand_, alleviating the financial overhead of owning and operating computing resources in-house.

The improvement in network access and decreasing bandwidth prices progressively made scientific research workflows on public clouds such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud^[See https://aws.amazon.com/], Microsoft's Azure^[See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/] and Google's Cloud Platform ^[See https://cloud.google.com/] a viable option, with initial experiments reported as early as 2008 [@hazelhurst2008scientific].
This trend was followed by a maturing of the middleware stacks which were used to actually _construct_ the platforms of the public clouds, bringing the capability to deploy cloud services _internally_ in research institutes.
The first model to gain widespread traction was the IaaS model, enabling IT departments in Universities, NRENs and other research organisations to better manage their resources - improving efficiency and reducing financial overhead, for example.
