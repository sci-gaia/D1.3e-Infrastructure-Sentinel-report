    volume: '68'
    issue: '3'
    abstract: Cloud computing is an ascending technology that has introduced a new paradigm
      by rendering a rational computational model possible. It has changed the dynamics
      of IT consumption by means of a model that provides on-demand services over the
      Internet. Unlike the traditional hosting service, cloud computing services are
      paid for per usage and may expand or shrink based on demand. Such services are,
      in general, fully managed by cloud providers that require users nothing but a
      personal computer and an Internet access. In recent years, this model has attracted
      the attention of researchers, investors and practitioners, many of whom have proposed
      a number of applications, structures and fundamentals of cloud computing, resulting
      in various definitions, requirements and models. Despite the interest and advances
      in the field, issues such as security and privacy, service layer agreement, resource
      sharing, and billing have opened up new questions about the real gains of the
      model. Although cloud computing is based on a 50-year-old business model, evidence
      from this study indicates that cloud computing still needs to expand and overcome
      present limitations that prevent the full use of its potential. In this study,
      we critically review the state of the art in cloud computing with the aim of identifying
      advances, gaps and new challenges.

    title: The African Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network:The Ghana Antenna Conversion
    title-short: The African Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network
    container-title: arXiv:1608.02187 \[astro-ph\]
    note: 'arXiv: 1608.02187'
    abstract: The African Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (AVN) is a pan-African
      project that will develop Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observing capability
      in several countries across the African continent, either by conversion of existing
      telecommunications antennas into radio telescopes, or by building new ones. This
      paper focuses on the conversion of the Nkutunse satellite communication station
      (near Accra, Ghana), specifically the early mechanical and infrastructure upgrades,
      together with the development of a custom ambient receiver and digital backend.
      The paper concludes with what remains to be done, before the station can be commissioned
      as an operational VLBI station.

# Executive Summary

At the end of the Sci-GaIA project, a clear contribution to energising scientific endeavour can be demonstrated.
The project activities have directly resulted in a wealth of new services for communities of practice across a wide range of scientific and technical research areas.
These services have been developed in the context of  an Open Science Platform - a set of interoperable tools, services and platforms - which, when integrated appropriately into community-based science gateways, allow smooth execution of Open Science workflows.
This "opening up" of scientific research and the products thereof can be considered one of the drivers of a knowledge economy.  


The number and diversity of new science gateways and applications of the Open Science Platform components is testament to the success of the Sci-GaIA approach - exposing research software engineers to common and easy-to-use _interfaces_, and developing a coherent and reproducible event for transferring skills and co-developing new applications :  the hackfest.
However, these applications and use cases require a place to "live", beyond the initial development environment.
They require a production e-Infrastructure capable of supporting the complex needs of user communities, application suites and research workflows, supporting as many aspects of modern scientific research and scholarly communication.
Whereas these infrastructures have been in use for some time, they have often been designed and built with only a subset of the functionality that a research community needs in mind  - compute, data, identity, persistence and uniqueness infrastructures, for example, have generally been independently developed.
Such infrastructures are present to varying degrees in the regions which Sci-GaIA has targetted, Southern, Eastern and Western Africa - to various degrees.
The experience of the individual researcher also varies wildly in this region depending on their field of research, institute, country, etc.
Task 1.3 of Sci-GaIA addresses above all _interoperability_ between African and European initiatives, as they pertain the science gateways.

In this document, we highlight actions taken by Sci-GaIA during the course of the project in the execution of Task 1.3.
We provide some insight into the state of play of e-Infrastructures in the regions covered by Sci-GaIA, some outlook on possible paths of development in the near future.
We consider both digital infrastructures (communication networks, data infrastructures, compute and cloud infrastructures, _etc_) and aspects of the commons essential to smooth collaboration and interoperability.
We highlight the need for co-operation at all levels, knowledge sharing and the need to support technical as well as scientific communities.
Finally, we make some recommendations to various actors in the ecosystem based on observations and current developments, in promoting the sustainable development in the development of Open Infrastructures for Open Science.

# Introduction

<!-- tell the story of e-Infrastructure in Africa -->
<!-- main players in the networking, computing and data spaces -->

Access to digital infrastructure has long been seen as a means to accelerate the development of African society, leading to the term "digital divide".
There have thus been many interventions to address this.
An illustrative example is the investment in network connectivity and capacity can be considered.
In recent years, Africa has seen not only greatly increased network capacity landing on it's shores via undersea cables, but also extension of that capacity deeper into the hinterland and across borders.
Network connectivity provides the _potential_ to overcome aspects of the digital divide, but does not guarantee it.
A recent G20 policy brief [@insights] argues that _new skills_ are needed as well, in order to bridge the divide.

Science and technology go hand in hand, and exclusion from the one often implies exclusion from the other.
In many fields of scientific endeavour, it is impossible to compete or participate without access to the instruments and tools which are used in that field, such as synchrotrons, telescopes, gene sequencing machines, _etc_, even if they are not physically present in their home countries.
The attraction of such leading research infrastructure is shown in +@fig:cernusers , where almost 25 % of the users are from countries which are not members.

![Distribution of all CERN Users by Nationality on 12 January 2016 [@Shave:2152388]](images/World_users_by_Nat_2016.jpg){#fig:cernusers width=15cm}

![Map of synchrotron light sources worldwide. From the map, we can see that there are no synchtron light sources in Africa.

However, scientists across the world have been enabled not only by these specialised machines, but also by the networks which connect them from their far-flung location to the other scientists using them, the data which they generate and the scientific applications and output which are used to analyse, interpret and disseminate them.
As an example although there are no synchrotron light sources on the African continent, the field of palaeontology,  which relies heavily on these instruments to analyse samples [@cunningham_virtual_2014], has produced leading scientific results by African authors^[It should be noted, though, that this research is not _published_ in African journals.] [@berger2010australopithecus].

Exclusion from _this_ infrastructure - the infrastructure of modern digital science, and the skills which accompany it - severely affects efforts to address any form of development, particularly sustainable development^[See the UN Sustainable Development Goals http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/].  

## Scope

This document does not attempt to portray an exhaustive survey of the outlook for e-Infrastructure in Africa - the rate of change of underlying factors such as population demographics, public-sector investment, technology trends, _etc_ alone make this a Sisyphean task.
The geographical scope alone makes this a task more suited to larger agencies or projects.
Neither do we consider it to be worthwhile to focus on individual projects, outcomes or results, which one may be tempted to see as indicative of trends.
The cross-cutting nature and ubiquity of e-Infrastructures in supporting modern science means that their are several narratives and interpretations.
Bodies such as the [e-Infrastructure Reflection Group (e-IRG)](http://www.e-irg.org) provide a useful canvas against which to draw our vision and recommendations, and we will follow some of their publications in our discussion of [The General e-Infrastructure Landscape Sentinel](#the-general-e-infrastructure-landscape-sentinel).

Furthermore, this document takes its cue from the project proposal :

>  To ensure the interoperability and interoperation between the African, the EU and other regions of the world’s e-Infrastructures, this task will establish an e-Infrastructure “sentinel” to watch over other relevant activities across the world.
> This task will periodically report to the other WPs to ensure efforts are harmonised with other global activities and will support the dissemination of our work to other projects worldwide.
> This task will have a single deliverable that will report on the global “picture” of e-Infrastructures and how developments within our project interoperate with other initiatives worldwide.

Rather than attempt to provide a complete description of e-Infrastructures in Africa, we therefore limit our scope to the experience during the project, focussing on efforts to maintain and extend interoperability between sites and initiatives participating or associated to the [Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre (AAROC)](http://www.africa-grid.org).
An implication of this scope is that we will discuss mostly network and compute  infrastructure, which is the most formalised aspect of interoperability, with more or less formal arrangements in place for interoperability at a low level.
In the case of compute platforms, this is governed by an MoU between the European Grid Initiative (EGI.eu) and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) as representatives of European and African distributed computing infrastructures respectively, which we discuss in the section on [Computing](#computing)

As such, this document should not be seen as an authoritative source on the state of e-Infrastructure in Africa, but an informed opinion on specific aspects of it which have evolved during the course of the project.
We provide our interpretation of the state of affairs and recommendations based thereupon.

## The need for an e-Infrastructure Sentinel

The Sci-GaIA project was run during a particularly sensitive period in the development of e-Infrastructures in Africa.

For much of 21st century, e-Infrastructures were not resolvable at a regional level in Africa, since there was simply no real development or resources.
Taking a network-centric point of view, it could  be argued that features of national regional e-Infrastructure started  to emerge with the development of the regional NRENs - UbuntuNet Alliance, ASREN and WACREN respectively.
From the point of view of scientific research programmes, it could be argued that regional e-Infrastructure started to emerge once Africans had access to big science projects, such as the LHC experiments at CERN^[ATLAS, ALICE and CMS have African membership at the time of writing - Egypt (CMS), Morroco (ATLAS), South Africa (ALICE, ATLAS)] ^[See CMS participation at https://cms.cern/collaboration/cms-institutes] [@noauthor_collaboration_2015][@noauthor_42_nodate], the Co-Ordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)^[CORDEX regional downscaling for  the Sub-Saharan region was done by the Climate Systems Analysis Group at the University of  Cape Town], more recently the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3A) Bioinformatics network (H3ABioNet)^[H3ABioNet has a consortium consisting of over 20 institutes across 15 countries in Africa. See http://www.h3abionet.org/home/consortium] shown in +@fig:ska_membership or indeed the African Very long baseline Network (AVN) [@copley_african_2016] and Square Kilometer Array projects (See +@fig:ska_membership), to name just a few.

![Membership of the Square Kilometer Array, including phase 2 African partner countries - Botswana, Nambia, Zambia, Mozambique, Mauritius, Kenya, Ghana and Madagascar, [@noauthor_participating_nodate]](images/ska-world-map-november-2014-final-1024x723.png){#fig:ska_membership width=7cm}

![H3Abionet ](images/h3abionet.png){#fig:h3a_membership width=7cm}

These projects, and others of their scale, have a few factors in common :

  * Several institutes in Africa participating
  * often multi-disciplinary in nature
  * Large data sets requiring long-term acquisition and preservation and shared computing platforms

A similar perspective could be envisaged taking the point of view of data or other scholarly output. The need for better access to - for lack of a better word - _libraries_ has stifled the pace of African research output significantly.
In each of these cases, cost and privilege played their role in stretching the digital divide even wider and constricting the capacity to generate, share and disseminate knowledge in Africa.

We would point out one aspect in particular though - the need for _co-operation_ in providing computing resources to their communities.
The services, infrastructures and resources needed could not be built, operated or maintained by one single institute or group; what is more, their functions were so generic as to stir interest in them across almost all research domains.
This need for co-operation has in many cases led to the creation of regional and national organisations in order to provide the scale necessary to build the human, technical and indeed capital resources necessary to fulfil the aims of various research agendas.

In the early 2000's, several efforts were funded by the European Commission in particular to promote cooperation between African and European e-Infrastructures. Chief amongst these for the purposes of this report are the CHAIN[@andronico2011infrastructures] and CHAIN-REDS[@barbera2014chain],[@prnjat_enabling_2015] projects.
These two projects looked specifically at the technical and policy aspects necessary to enable both the internal sustainability of regional infrastructures, as well as the inter-operability of these as a whole across regions.
They were conceived during the "crossover" phase between the end of the EGEE series of projects and their spinoffs in world regions^[We refer here to the long list of "EU-X-Grid" projects: EUAsiaGrid, EUIndiaGrid, EUChinaGrid, EUMedGrid and EELA/GISELA. ] and the start of EGI, EUDAT and other
Whilst modest in initial impact, compared to the massive investments currently undertaken by _e.g._ the Square Kilometer Array, these support actions served to create a  community of technical skill at a continental scale which persist to this day.

Sci-GaIA has taken an approach less focussed on the infrastructure, and more in the scientist.
By making the infrastructure "invisible" to the researcher, the project has been able to keep them focussed on what matters to them : their research agenda.
This has shown great success, which the Sci-GaIA champions are a testament to, but the underlying assumption is that there _will be infrastructure_ which can absorb this newly-energised scientific workload.
The great dichotomy of digital infrastructures is that they are essential to modern research, but they work best when they "disappear" - _i.e._ when there is such a low barrier to entry and lack of friction in the system that researchers almost forget that they are using them.
While we consider such a situation a good one for the user, it is crucially important to acknowledge the role of the infrastructure developers, and the constant effort made to ensure that these tools for discovery are both kept up to date and made interoperable with one another.

As e-Infrastructures themselves, as well as their underlying building blocks, evolve, it is important to lift our eyes to the nearby horizon periodically, to assess our achievements and plot the next few steps in our course.

## Actions taken by Sci-GaIA to promote interoperability

During the course of Sci-GaIA, the project has taken steps to address interoperability in terms of infrastructures and platforms.
These relationships have been with EGI, THOR^[an MoU was signed with the THOR project during the first year of Sci-GaIA and one of the Sci-GaIA members (B. Becker) was a THOR ambassador during the project.
The MoU was essentially to promote uptake and visibility of the services of ORCID and DataCite.] and Indigo DataCloud^[Indigo DataCloud is an H2020 project aimed at developing data centre solutions for research clouds].

A workshop was also organised in the occasion of ICRI 2016, in Cape Town, in order to discuss technical aspects of Open Infrastructure and adoption of  an Open Science commons.  

Finally, a session was dedicated to open infrastructure at the Sci-GaIA Final Conference in Pretoria

### Interoperability with European infrastructures
<!-- MoU -->

The core of the infrastructure interoperability aspect of WP1 has been through application of the MoU [@egi-doc-2407-v2] with EGI stipulating the terms for interoperability between the African and European infrastructures.
The scope of this MoU was restricted to grid infrastructures originally - later extended to cloud infrastructures - falling in the Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre (AAROC).
It describes a series of activities and operating level agreements (OLAs) which should be adopted by sites in the region^[We refer to the region and the regional operations centre interchangeably.
The ROC refers to sites which adhere to the procedures and OLA's stipulated in the MoU.].
A continuous effort in WP1 was dedicated to maintaining the OLAs at sites in the ROC, the performance of which is measured by EGI.
The infrastructure resource provider MoU^[This type of MoU is signed between EGI and peer infrastructures such as AAROC, compared for example to the MoU between EGI and another project. See https://www.egi.eu/about/collaborations/ for more information.] permits research collaborations which have membership in Africa and Europe to easily benefit from the resources in both regions, as well as align operations and technical procedures in the regions to each other.
This MoU continues to provide the basis for the interoperability of compute infrastructures which we describe below.

### Improving context and exposure in future infrastructures

<!-- collaboration with IndigoDataCloud -->
A further aspect of this task in WP1 was to keep track of changes and evolution of the e-Infrastructure landscape in an attempt to harmonise activities to a certain extent across the regions.
The rapid uptake and evolution of cloud computing for science has characterised the contemporary period, making it essential to have good "peripheral vision" when it  comes to building e-Infrastructures.
Sci-GaIA has worked very closely with Indigo DataCloud during the course of the two projects.
The aim was to expose the technical and scientific communities of practice supported by Sci-GaIA to the tools and products of Indigo DataCloud, providing constructive feedback and evaluation in the context of African institutes.
This was evidenced by the strong collaboration during the e-Research Hackfests^[These are detailed in Sci-GaIA Deliverable 2.4 - "Energising scientific endeavour: experiences of supporting communities of practice with science gateways and e-infrastructures" [@Tenhunen:562].] [@bruce_becker_2016_208216],  and the output of the [Sci-GaIA Champions' Use Cases](https://www.sci-gaia.eu/champions).
The inaugural e-Research Hackfest^[See http://www.sci-gaia.eu/summer-hackfest] brought the developers of many of the key products of the Indigo DataCloud together with representatives of user communities supported by Sci-GaIA, with a view to developing applications in an Open Science Platform.
The close collaboration between Sci-GaIA and Indigo DataCloud was important in allowing a good understanding of the evolution of e-Infrastructure stacks, and permitted the Sci-GaIA hackfests and other training events to provide good contextual suggestions to participants, in developing their applications.
We elaborate on this aspet of co-development in our discussion of [Training and Skills](#training-and-skills) below.

### Technical workshops on Open Infrastructure

Open Science has emerged as a strong theme during the course of Sci-GaIA.
As a movement, Open Science has gained momentum significantly during the course of  the project, although its  origins are far earlier.
Sci-GaIA has promoted the goals and principles of Open Science in several fora, including project workshops, research outputs, dissemination and presentations to conferences, _etc_.
However, a fact which is often overlooked is  that Open Science - or more specifically Open and Reproducible Science - requires infrastructures to work smoothly between them.

The first workshop on Open Infrastructure was organised in occasion of the 2016 ICRI conference in Cape Town.
This event, held on 6 October 2016 at the Centre for High-Performance Computing (CHPC) brought together developers and stakeholders from key initiatives in Europe and South Africa to discuss aspects of the commons, open science workflows and requirements, and developments in data, networking and cloud infrastructures.
Representing the interests of infrastructure and commons initiatives, were EGI FedCloud, the South African National Research Network, CHPC and the South African Identity Federation.
Presentations from two key research activities (H3ABioNet and SKA) requiring geographically distributed regions were included in the agenda, as well as contributions on the needs of Open Science (by Sci-GaIA).
The example of VI-SEEM as a regional initiative enabling collaborative and open science.
This workshop served as the starting point for the Open Infrastructures session at the Sci-GaIA Final Conference.  
This session included further contributions from the Centre for  High-Performance Computing (CHPC) and the African Research Cloud (ARC), as well as the Data-Intensive Research Infrastructure for South Africa (DIRISA).

# The General e-Infrastructure landscape

<!-- talk about patterns in e-Infrastructure  -->
<!-- Follow  the format of http://e-irg.eu/catalogue/eirg-1002 -->
In the following section, we provide an overview of the e-Infrastructure landscape, in the context of Sci-GaIA partners and activities.
We generally aim to follow the structure of the e-Infrastructures Reflection Group (e-IRG) 2016 Roadmap [@eirg_roadmap_2016], looking at network, computing, data and clouds, as well as services which are located in the "e-Infrastructure Commons."
Here, we refer to the commons as the seen by the Sci-GaIA conception of an Open Science Platform, depicted in +@fig:osp and reported in Deliverable  3.2^["Science Gateway and e-Infrastructure Service Provision: Update and Sustainability". See https://oar.sci-gaia.eu/record/566].

![The Sci-GaIA Open Science Platform - schematic diagram [@OSP]. Note that in our conception, e-Infrastructure itself is placed in the "Commons" sector, along with enabling technologies and shared platforms.](images/open-science-platform.jpg){#fig:osp width=15cm}

## Networking
<!-- general developments and comments in networking -->

Network connectivity is the foundation of e-Infrastructures. Africa - particularly West and Central Africa - has lagged behind Europe and North-America in terms of access to network infrastructure by research and academic communities.
This has in the past stifled the capacity and  ambition to undertake large science projects.
Compared to the turn of the century, the situation in countries in the Southern and Eastern African region has improved markedly.
Undersea cables (See +@fig:undersea_cables ) such as SEACOM^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEACOM_(African_cable_system] and WACS^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WACS_(cable_system)] have not only increased the capacity of available bandwidth, but drastically reduced the price of international bandwidth[@ITUpricing],[@internet_society_international_2016].

![The evolution of undersea cables in Africa [@song_sub-saharan_2016].](images/output/tmp-16.png){#fig:undersea_cables width=16cm}

The effect of cheaper bandwidth has been augmented by a greater number of routes, as well as greater flexibility in routing and improved reliability. A corresponding effort has also been made to improve the backhaul capacity[@noauthor_afterfibre_nodate] and regional peering.

However, the vast geographic scale and sparsity of African countries has implications for  the reach of expensive fibre networks.
To  this end, a significant body of research has been published regarding the feasibility of wireless broadband networks.
We note here the Serengeti Broadband Network (SBN) [@nungu_design_2011] which is one of the innovative means of connecting people and instruments in difficult, sparse terrain.

<!-- Africa Connect -->

The wealth of network capacity and connections continues to open ever more possibilities for human networks, in all aspects of human endeavour, but particularly in the domains of education, research and science.
Whether this increase in potential will translate into more and better scientific output depends on several factors, including co-ordination.  
To this end, the [AfricaConnect](https://www.africaconnect.eu/Pages/Home.aspx) and [AfricaConnect 2](https://www.africaconnect2.net/Pages/Home.aspx) projects have provided significant impact down to the  "last-person" - the African researcher sitting in the African institute.
With a solid situation in research and education networking, advanced services for science can be constructed.

### Science DMZs

<!-- talk about the use of dmz's -->
We note here one particular aspect of exploiting R&E networking to it's fullest, which has implications for subsequent services and resources described  below : demilitarised zones for science (Science DMZs)^[See the ESNet web page for a good description and discussion of Science DMZs: https://fasterdata.es.net/science-dmz/].

Science DMZ's  are "A network design pattern for data-intensive science" [@6877518], allowing greater end-to-end performance for scientific applications.
A few African NRENs^[In particular SANREN and KENET in South Africa and Kenya respectively.] have recently begun work on designing and implementing Science DMZ's in their region.
The outlook on wider deployment and interoperability between DMZ's is currently difficult to predict, but is necessary for the needs of distributed research projects such as H3A or the SKA.

## Computing infrastructures

<!--- hpc and grid Infrastructures -->
Computing infrastructures here refer specifically to "grid" and "HPC" infrastructures, while we discuss more amorphous cloud computing infrastructures below.
The distinction  between these and cloud infrastructures refers rather to the static nature of the former rather than any aspect of the typical workloads which are run on them.
HPC infrastructures, whether centralised in national facilities or distributed in grids across institutes, have matured significantly over the last 5 years or so, to the point that there are several standards for easily deploying these resources and many common approaches in operating them.
The cutting edge of HPC^[For consistency, we refer to the Top500 list as "the cutting edge".] is advancing exponentially [@top500] thanks to advances both in hardware and software, enabling higher resolution and scale in the quest for scientific knowledge.
However, the cutting edge belies the bulk of research which requires  simply access to comparatively pedestrian computing facilities, built cheaply with off-the-shelf components.
While still expensive for the average African institute, these smaller HPC clusters have been quietly advancing the research capacity and output across the region.
Their aggregation into grids, and operation as service-oriented platforms led to better collaboration at a technical level between institutes, and allowed researchers to consider problems and projects at scales previously impossible. The move to service-based platforms also helped to stimulate interest in the development and use of various clouds for research, which we discuss below in the [Cloud Infrastructures](#cloud_infrastructures) section.

<!-- What is the outlook ? -->

High-performance computing clusters are by their nature localised and have tended to act as attractors of expertise, in terms of building, maintaining and operating them.
With the maturity of  the "Infrastructure as Code" [@huttermann_infrastructure_2012] in the early 2010's, there was far better means to share technical know-how as well as tools to automate and reproduce the deployment of these and other services.
A similar effect has seen the better delivery of HPC applications, and improved their portability across sites, providing users with bet
We discuss this later  in section ["Infrastructure as Code"](#infrastructure_as_code).
The upshot is that it is becoming easier to rapidly scale and deliver both centralised and distributed computing facilities.

<!-- where are there sites ? -->
The Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre coordinates the computing resources at 9 sites^[See http://www.africa-grid.org/sites] across the African continent, making them available to users from these countries.

<!-- donations from CERN and TACC -->
In addition to these sites, other initiatives have aimed to bring computing hardware to areas of scientific activity via donations.
Second-hand services have been donated  by CERN [@cern_ghana] in 2012 and TACC [@tacc_ranger]  in 2104 have aimed at providing computing hardware to sites, in order stimulate HPC competence in Ghana and SADC countries respectively.
These resources could conceivably be included into the Africa-Arabia Regional Operations Centre in due course.

## Data Infrastructures
<!-- What data infrastructures are there ? -->

The importance of data infrastructures has been repeatedly stated, but these are far more difficult to harmonise and scale, in comparison  to the computing infrastructures we have mentioned in the previous section.
Furthermore, there is no existing federation or umbrella which data sites can integrate easily into, such as is the case with computing sites in the Regional Operations Centre^[To be clear, we are referring to data repositories, not transient data storage facilities. These can be added to sites in the ROC, and used by virtual organisations.]
The need to develop sustainable data infrastructures is made clearly in the RDA report on "Reaping the Data Harvest" [@europe2014data].
The importance of data to modern science and indeed society is evidenced by the complexity of the ecosystem.
In order to properly "reap the data harvest", a holistic approach to data has to be taken in developing data infrastructures, which often represents a significant barrier.
For this same reason, data infrastructures reside more comfortably in the "e-Infrastructure Commons", rather than as a specific, separate e-Infrastructure component.
A data infrastructure needs to be able manage the full life of data products, and as such be able to be FAIR and Open.
Africa has seen a significant rise in Open Data initiatives over recent years. We note for illustrative purposes the efforts of two of the largest initiatives:

  * **CodeForAfrica^[See http://codeforafrica.org]** -  Africa's largest data journalism and civic technology initiative, operating CitizenLabs across the continent^[See the  Open Data repository at https://africaopendata.org/].
  * **African Open Data ^[See http://dataportal.opendataforafrica.org/ ]** is an African Development Bank data repository of statistical data, developed in response to the increasing demand for statistical data and indicators relating to African Countries.

These represent on the one hand a community-based effort to liberate data from local and national government, and on the other an effort to publish data from a major funding and development agency. In both cases, the data is primarily of public interest.

We will focus however on FAIR data as it is more relevant to scientific research and scholarly communicataion.

Compared to services provided by projects such as  EUDAT^[See the EUDAT services at https://www.eudat.eu/services] [@lecarpentier2013eudat] and ANDS^[See the ANDS services at http://www.ands.org.au/online-services] [@treloar2009design], there simply is no data infrastructure in Africa - yet.
The lack of data infrastructure is of course not indicative of the the lack of it's _necessity_, nor does it imply the absence of African data - it means however that this data is _invisible_.
It was in recognition of  this need that the Sci-GaIA project proposed a KPI on the number of Open Access Repositories compliant with the OpenAIRE guidelines [@houssos_openaire_2014][@noauthor_openaire_nodate].

![Countries with data repositories registered in the Registry of Research Data Repositories (Re3Data). Note that countries in blue have no registered data repositories. See http://www.re3data.org/browse/by-country/](images/re3datarepos.png){#fig:re3data width=15cm}

<!-- SFSA, science international, DIRISA -->
The lack of visibility of African data repositories contributes to the low research output and impact of African science in general.
In order to improve this situation, a coherent long-term plan for research data management is needed.
The need for this has been highlighted several times, most recently at the recent meeting of the [AAU](https://www.aau.org/) in Ghana^[See https://events.aau.org/gencon14/].
We discuss the need for a data federation and metadata harvesting below in the [e-Infrastructure Commons](#the-e-infrastructure-commons), but this presupposes the existence of robust data repositories.
Sci-GaIA has promoted the adoption of Open Access data repositories, by cloning an existing service fully configured to expose proper metadata and potentially become part of a federation, which could alleviate this need.
At a national level, there is only one data infrastructure aimed at the development of a holistic, large-scale, persistent data infrastructure for general scientific purpose, which is the Data-Intensive Research Infrastructure (DIRISA) in South Africa^[See the DIRISA web page at http://www.dirisa.ac.za/].
As a data infrastructure, DIRISA provides the means to implement various national policies, such as the Open Access policy on publicly-funded research [@patrick_nrf_2015], as well as systems for developing research data management plans, long-term preservation, _etc_.
As a national infrastructure, DIRISA is developed in concertation with other components of an integrated system (NICIS), providing other data services such as data movement in and out of Science DMZs, replication across repositories, etc.
DIRISA will provide a key service to South African researchers and research institutes, in the form of a catch-all repository for scholarly output.
Such a service is also provided by projects such as Zenodo and others, however the benefit of being able to integrate the repository data with institutional CRIS systems may allow for far better evaluation of research output.
Whilst similar initiatives are currently being considered by various institutes, including the regional NREN Alliances, none are currently in production.


## Clouds

Cloud computing is a business and operations model which offers various resources _as a service_ to users. This has evolved into essentially three main service models [@Durao2014] :

  * **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
  * **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
  * **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

The models differ in their usage and access models, but more importantly in the level of _flexibility_ vis-a-vis _ease of use_ for end  users.
By comparison, the grid computing paradigm offered a platform as a service, with an inflexible access model, and limited control over execution models.
The increased flexibility of the cloud computing model was thus very attractive to users and sites which were discouraged by the rigid model of grid computing.
The cloud _business_ model made it easier to access relevant computing platforms _on demand_, alleviating the financial overhead of owning and operating computing resources in-house.

The improvement in network access and decreasing bandwidth prices progressively made scientific research workflows on public clouds such as Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud^[See https://aws.amazon.com/], Microsoft's Azure^[See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/] and Google's Cloud Platform ^[See https://cloud.google.com/] a viable option, with initial experiments reported as early as 2008 [@hazelhurst2008scientific].
This trend was followed by a maturing of the middleware stacks which were used to actually _construct_ the platforms of the public clouds, bringing the capability to deploy cloud services _internally_ in research institutes.
The first model to gain widespread traction was the IaaS model, enabling IT departments in Universities, NRENs and other research organisations to better manage their resources - improving efficiency and reducing financial overhead, for example.
The maturing of various cloud stacks has made it ever more attactive to deploy large-scale private clouds to support local research agenda at an institutional level.
Toolkits such as OpenStack^[OpenStack is "a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing." See https://www.openstack.org/ ], OpenNebula^[OpenNebula is "a cloud computing platform for managing heterogeneous distributed data center infrastructures". See https://opennebula.org ] [@opennebula] and Synnefo^[Synnefo is "a complete open source cloud stack written in Python that provides Compute, Network, Image, Volume and Storage services, similar to the ones offered by AWS." See https://www.synnefo.org/] [@koukis2013synnefo], amongst others^[We make reference to these, since  they are the stacks which are compatible with the EGI Federated Cloud. They are by no means the only cloud stacks.] make creating an IaaS offering at an institute or group level viable.
The attraction of these cloud middleware stacks is similar to the lure of being able to create cheap supercomputers built of COTS components - with comparatively little capital and effort, a powerful tool for research could be provided to researchers.
However, similar issues as before immediately had to be addressed - how could these tools be effectively shared in a collaborative environment ?
<!-- Federation -->

One of  the solutions to this was the development of the EGI Federated Cloud [@fedcloud15] which was launched in 2015.
This new platform promised the flexibility of cloud infrastructures, combined with the tools and services which researchers need to collaborate - access to data, applications, identity management frameworks, etc.
The development of the EGI FedCloud has been in the wider context of the  European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) [@eosc].

An effort undertaken during the CHAIN-REDS project to survey the usage of clouds in research environments [@prnjat_surveying_2015] found very low adoption rates in Sub-Saharan Africa.
This was interpreted in part as being due to the relative immaturity of the cloud stacks, the lack of adequate bandwidth, and the lack of skills necessary to manage these infrastructures.
Thus, whilst small clouds have been used widely across the region, they rarely extend beyond the boundaries of the institute.
With the improving situation in networking described in [the Networking section](#networking), and large science projects discussed in [the Introduction](#introduction), tentative forays have been made into the deployment of clouds at national and regional scale.

We mention two illustrative examples here.
The first is the so-called African Research Cloud [@simmonds_african_2016] (ARC).
This is an OpenStack-based cloud, primarily for astronomy and bioinformatics research.
ARC is distributed across two data centres, making it currently the only distributed research cloud in per-se in Africa.
The second is a new Synnefo-based deployment in the Lagos region serving the WACREN community.
A call for pilot  applications is currently underway^[See http://wacren.net/en/news/wacren-cloud-pilot-open-call], and many of the use cases of the West African Sci-GaIA champions are being migrated to this cloud.

IaaS clouds are rapidly becoming commonplace in the African context, as connectivity between terrestrial sites improves and knowhow and technical confidence is improved.

What remains to be seen is whether these new resources can be federated and offered as a single platform to African researchers.
Other technical issues also represent hurdles which will require above all co-ordination :

  * user interfaces and APIs
  * authentication and authorisation across resources
  * application delivery
  * support for scientific workflow toolkits
  * data replication and hosting

As part of WP1, we have maintained contact with the developers of these cloud platforms - many of which are independently members of the Africa-Arabia ROC, with a view to integrating these new cloud services into the Operations Database^[The Global Operations Database (GOC) is part of the EGI federation services. See https://www.egi.eu/internal-services/].


# The e-Infrastructure Commons

<!-- what's in the commons ? -->

The e-Infrastructure Commons is referred to in the e-IRG Roadmaps and White Papers as far back as the e-IRG Roadmap 2012 [@eirg_roadmap_2012].
The Roadmap 2016 states :

> The e-Infrastructure Commons is the framework for an easy and cost-effective shared use of
distributed electronic resources for research and innovation

As such, we consider these parts of e-Infrastructure although less tangible, no less necessary than the previous ones (networks, compute, data, cloud) in ensuring a vibrant research ecosystem :

  * Identity and security services
  * FAIR data services
  * Training and skills
  * Infrastructure as Code

## Identity and security services

<!-- identity federations -->
Sci-GaIA has promoted identity federations in order to act as the "front door" to the Open Science Platform^[See sectio 1.1 of Sci-GaIA deliverable 3.2 "Strengthen and expand Science Gateway and e-Infrastructure related services"].
The benefits of developing services for use in a federation has been widely disseminated by the eduGAIN team^[See https://www.geant.org/Services/Trust_identity_and_security/eduGAIN/Pages/Benefits-of-eduGAIN.aspx] and there are advantages for both identity managers and service developers.
In all of the e-Research Hackfests organised so far by the Sci-GaIA, the use cases have been designed to be accessed via identity providers in federations.

There is a Catch-22 however when it comes to users with no identity federation

<!-- csirts -->

## FAIR data services
<!-- What are FAIR data services  ? -->

FAIR data principles [@wilkinson_fair_2016] are expressed in the join FORCE-11 declaration^[See https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples for current information.] are

> "a set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable."

In order to put these principles into action, services and tools are required, as well as underlying infrastructure.
Chief amongst the latter is of course a decent network, allowing access to first the tools and then the data itself.
The ability to find and access data relies primarily on the _uniqueness_ of the data and the ability of machines to comprehend information about it.
This in turn translates into the need for uniqueness and persistence services for datasets  as well data repositories which are able to expose well-formed metadata.

The main needs in this are

  * access to relevant persistence and uniqueness frameworks
  * metadata harvesters and semantic search engines

As mentioned above in [Actions taken by Sci-GaIA(#actions-taken-by-sci-gaia-to-promote-interoperability) and reported in other deliverables, we have worked with DataCite to provide DOI prefixes to data repositories supported by the project.

A harvesting service to collect the metadata^[Metadata is a particularly thorny issue. Many data sets abide only by loose community standards, and not some universally-agreed standard. However, the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) could be used as a baseline.] would allow indexing and citation to be done in a more systematic way.
This has often been stated as one of the future goals of Open Science and Open Access initiatives on the African continent, leading to a knowledge infrastructure similar to OpenAIRE.
The start of the African Open Science Platform (AOSP)^[Not to be confused with the Sci-GaIA Open Science Platform. The AOSP is a policy and training framwork supported by the South African Academy of  Science and and Department of Science and Technology] in 2016 gives hope in this direction.

## Training and Skills

The argument has been made that robust digital skills are important to overcoming the digital divide and participating fully an Open Science paradigm - perhaps _as_ important as e-Infrastructure itself.
We make the the point that these skills are important at every point in the Open Science ecosystem - it is important for those building the infrastructure, those developing the services, those conducting science and all those evaluating the the products and created at each point in the chain, to have a good fundamental digital skills.
As with e-Infrastructure, no single institute can be responsible for developing digital skills, and it is important to consider contributions to the development of these skills in the commons.
We comment on certain models and patterns which have been observed to have good effect.

<!-- carpentry -->
First of all, the "Carpentries" - software carpentry [@wilson2006software], data carpentry [@teal2015data], library carpentry [@playforth2015information] and others - have had considerable success in building both communities of educators and the basic skills of researchers and infrastructure developers.
We have adapted the carpentry model of a two-day intensive bootcamp for the infrastructure domain, together with the "Infrastructure as Code" paradigm to develop "DevOps Bootcamp" format [@devops_bootcamp].
These training events are supporting e-Infrastructure by developing curricula in Open and reproducible formats, and in some cases are peer-reviewed.

Secondly, we note the effort undertaken by Mozilla Science Lab^[Mozilla Science Lab is a "community of researchers, developers, and librarians making research open and accessible. We’re empowering open science leaders through fellowships, mentorship, and project-based learning.", supported by the Mozilla Foundation. See  https://science.mozilla.org/ for more.] to formalise Open Collaboration and community building in scientific collaborations.
The "Working Open Workshop"^[See https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/index.html] provide a solid foundation to the practice of open collaboration, which is crucial in scientific research as it is in e-Infrastructure development as for the reasons we have outlined in this section.

These two movements have strongly informed the format of Sci-GaIA's e-Research Hackfests, where we incorporate aspects of the carpentry pedagogy into the initial sessions and aspects of Working Open in the subsequent development sprints.

It may be worthwhile to spend a few words on the skills and tools necessary for typical "Big Data" and "Machine Learning" workflows.
The

##  Infrastructure as Code

<!-- what is infrastructure as code -->
We are used to thinking of "infrastructure" in terms of its physical components - cables, servers, disk arrays, etc.
These physical _objects_ are concrete, localised and indeed form the building blocks of any ICT infrastructure.
However, merely owning these physical resources does not guarantee that efficient use will be made of them.
In the past, there have been cases where infrastructure has been donated to African institutes, in the hope of providing them with a tool to improve their lives.
Instead, without the relevant skills and enabling ecosystem in which to operate the equipment, this type of donation can result in a burden instead of a positive investment.
ICT infrastructure is no less prone to this kind of unintended consequence and in some cases physical resources become a drain on the already taxed ICT support  staff at universities and research laboratories, with the nett effect of the equipment going to waste.  

However, functioning e-Infrastructure exists in a _context_, including both the physical resources themslves, as well as the _configuration_ and _orchestration_ of those resources at a site.
As hardware and interfaces become more and more virtualised, a paradigm has arisen whereby infrastructure is represented _in software_ - the "Infrastructure as Code" paradigm [@huttermann_infrastructure_2012].
This paradigm holds significant benefits for regions with high demand and sparse experts, such as ours.

  1. **Executable Infrastructure**: e-Infrastructure components can be expressed in software. With appropriate tools these can be executed, just as normal "programs", generating entire e-Infrastructures on bare hardware.
  2. **Knowledge sharing**: Recipes for executing e-Infrastructure can be shared, peer-reviewed, and accept contributions from the community. The infrastructure is expressive, making it more understandable to new community members, and avoiding a culture of locking know-how away in silos.
  3. **Reproducible Infrastructure**: The expression of service orchestration can be customised for various sites, making the work done to write the expression of e-Infrastructure in software re-usable. This is a big step towards making Open Infrastructure, but also speeds up the deployment of new sites where there may be no local expertise.
  4. **Reliable Infrastructure**: By adopting an Infrastructure as Code approach, many good practices of software engineering can be applied:  change control, peer review, testing, continuous integration, _etc_. This makes for reliable infrastructure, which has been independently tested in various environments, and also gives research infrastructure developers the confidence to embark on ambitious projects to extend the services without disruption.
  5. **Automation**: Finally, by adopting an Infrastructure as Code approach, much of  the day-to-day management and operation of e-Infrastructure services can be automated. This relieves the burden on site administrators, and may free up time for other activities such as training, research _etc_.

This approach has been heavily adopted in the Africa-Arabia ROC, with almost all of the services provided in the distributed computing infrastructure and identity federation expressed as code [@executable_infrastructure], [@bruce_becker_2016_59296].
Since the code is openly licensed, tested and published, it can be re-used with proper attribution to build new resources in the commons or at any of the sites wish to participate to the Africa-Arabia ROC.
We have also worked to develop the skills necessary to use this code, in the [DevOps Bootcamps](#training-and-skills) referred to above.


# Outlook

In this section, we aim to give an interpretation of the short-term development of e-Infrastructures in the region.
It should be stated that these statements are merely the opinion of the authors, and do not mean to speak on behalf of funding authorities or the institutes of the consortium as a whole.  

Unlike Europe and perhaps Australia, there is no strongly-coordinated approach to the development of a harmonised e-Infrastructure ecosystem in the regions of Africa.
While there are several national initiatives underway to develop some form of e-Infrastructure^[Perhaps the South African National Integrated Cyberinfrastructure Initiative (NICIS) is  the most mature at the time of writing. See https://www.csir.co.za/national-integrated-cyber-infrastructure-system], there doesn't appear to be a coordinated regional effort at the level of the European Open Science Cloud or any of the other European infrastructure initiatives.

The advent of "big science" projects in Africa has indeed stimulated interest in shared and distributed infrastructure, with notable new efforts in astronomy and bioinformatics domains following similar developments for high-energy physics.
It is safe to predict that there will be strong development in terms of data infrastructure in parts of Africa, given the strong data science and open data communities.
These will likely flourish where there is abundandt bandwidth and well-connected communities.

# Conclusions and Recommendations

We have been fortunate in the Sci-GaIA project to have witnessed  and participated in a great flourish in e-Infrastructures in Africa, following a general trend of increasing adoption.
The strategy of the project in supporting the underlying components of e-Research has been to focus on the research case, the community applications and tools, and strong engagement at the platform level.
By using the science gateway concept as a common parlance, we have managed to greatly stimulate the uptake of e-Infrastructures.


## Challenges

However, there are some possible risks and challenges ahead

  * Lack of coordination can lead to conflict and isolation
  * Lack of common dissemination plan can lead to ignorance amongst users of the platform itself

## Recommendations

<!-- Continue supporting the ROC -->

<!-- adopt the open science platform -->

<!-- run design your e-infrastructure workshops -->

<!-- build DMZs and cloud and services within them -->

<!-- use open licenses -->


<!-- adopt identity federations -->

<!-- carpentry -->

<!-- add sites to the ROC -->
