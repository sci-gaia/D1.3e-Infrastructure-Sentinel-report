    volume: '68'
    issue: '3'
    abstract: Cloud computing is an ascending technology that has introduced a new paradigm
      by rendering a rational computational model possible. It has changed the dynamics
      of IT consumption by means of a model that provides on-demand services over the
      Internet. Unlike the traditional hosting service, cloud computing services are
      paid for per usage and may expand or shrink based on demand. Such services are,
      in general, fully managed by cloud providers that require users nothing but a
      personal computer and an Internet access. In recent years, this model has attracted
      the attention of researchers, investors and practitioners, many of whom have proposed
      a number of applications, structures and fundamentals of cloud computing, resulting
      in various definitions, requirements and models. Despite the interest and advances
      in the field, issues such as security and privacy, service layer agreement, resource
      sharing, and billing have opened up new questions about the real gains of the
      model. Although cloud computing is based on a 50-year-old business model, evidence
      from this study indicates that cloud computing still needs to expand and overcome
      present limitations that prevent the full use of its potential. In this study,
      we critically review the state of the art in cloud computing with the aim of identifying
      advances, gaps and new challenges.

    title: The African Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network:The Ghana Antenna Conversion
    title-short: The African Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network
    container-title: arXiv:1608.02187 \[astro-ph\]
    note: 'arXiv: 1608.02187'
    abstract: The African Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (AVN) is a pan-African
      project that will develop Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observing capability
      in several countries across the African continent, either by conversion of existing
      telecommunications antennas into radio telescopes, or by building new ones. This
      paper focuses on the conversion of the Nkutunse satellite communication station
      (near Accra, Ghana), specifically the early mechanical and infrastructure upgrades,
      together with the development of a custom ambient receiver and digital backend.
      The paper concludes with what remains to be done, before the station can be commissioned
      as an operational VLBI station.
